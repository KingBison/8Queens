# 8Queens
A project for my Artificial Intelligence class

By running main.py, the console will find an 8x8 matrix of ones and zeros where...

every 1 is on a unique row,
every 1 is on a unique column,
there are no diagonal conflicts

This utilizes machine learning to find a randomized solution


I used VS Code to run
